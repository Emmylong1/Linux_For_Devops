# How does internet work?
The Internet is a global network that connects millions of computers and other devices, allowing them to communicate and share information. The key components and processes that make the Internet work include:

1. **Devices (Computers, Servers, and Devices):**
   - Computers, servers, and various devices are connected to the Internet. These devices communicate with each other using standardized protocols.

2. **Internet Service Providers (ISPs):**
   - ISPs are companies that provide the connection between your device and the larger Internet. They offer various types of connections, such as broadband, DSL, or fiber optics.

3. **Protocols:**
   - The Internet relies on a set of protocols (rules and conventions) that dictate how data is transmitted and received. Some essential protocols include:
     - **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol):** This suite of protocols is the foundation of the Internet. It ensures that data is broken into packets, transmitted, and reassembled correctly at the destination.
     - **HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol/Secure):** Used for transferring web pages.
     - **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):** Used for transferring files.
     - **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):** Used for email transmission.
     - **DNS (Domain Name System):** Translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses.

4. **Routers and Switches:**
   - Routers and switches are network devices that help direct data packets between different devices on the Internet. Routers connect different networks, while switches manage traffic within a network.

5. **Data Centers:**
   - Large facilities known as data centers house servers and other networking equipment. These centers store and process massive amounts of data, providing services like web hosting, cloud computing, and online applications.

6. **Backbone:**
   - The Internet backbone is a high-speed, long-distance network that connects major nodes or data centers. It ensures data can be transmitted across long distances quickly and efficiently.

7. **DNS (Domain Name System):**
   - The DNS translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network.

8. **Web Browsers and Clients:**
   - Web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) and other software act as clients, allowing users to access information and services on the Internet.

9. **Security Protocols:**
   - Various security protocols (e.g., SSL/TLS for secure connections) help ensure the privacy and integrity of data transmitted over the Internet.

10. **World Wide Web (WWW):**
    - The WWW is a collection of interconnected documents and resources linked by hyperlinks. It's accessed using web browsers, and it's just one part of the broader Internet.

# Diff between web server and application server?
**Web Server:**
A web server is a software application or hardware device that handles the HTTP requests from clients (typically web browsers) and responds by serving static content such as HTML, images, CSS, and JavaScript files. Its primary function is to process incoming requests and return the requested files to the client. Web servers are designed to handle basic web protocols, managing the transfer of static content efficiently. Examples of web servers include Apache HTTP Server and Nginx. They play a fundamental role in delivering the static components of a website to users.

**Application Server:**
On the other hand, an application server is responsible for executing dynamic, server-side logic and processing dynamic content. It handles more complex tasks beyond serving static files, such as database queries, business logic, and application processing. Application servers support the dynamic generation of content, often in response to user inputs or requests. They interact with databases, perform computations, and generate dynamic web pages. Common examples of application servers include Tomcat, JBoss, and Microsoft IIS (when configured to serve as an application server). Application servers work in conjunction with web servers, with the web server forwarding dynamic content requests to the application server for processing.

# what is server, client and DNS ?
**Server:**
A server is a computer or a software application that provides services or resources to other computers, known as clients, over a network. Servers are designed to handle and fulfill requests from clients. They can serve various purposes, such as hosting websites, managing email communications, storing files, and running applications. Servers are typically more powerful and have specialized hardware and software configurations to handle multiple client requests simultaneously.

**Client:**
A client, in the context of networking and computing, refers to a computer or a software application that requests services, resources, or information from a server. Clients initiate communication with servers by sending requests, and they are responsible for processing the responses received from servers. Clients can range from personal computers and laptops to mobile devices and applications that access services over a network. Web browsers, email clients, and file transfer programs are common examples of client applications.

**DNS (Domain Name System):**
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a decentralized hierarchical system that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses. Computers on the Internet communicate using IP addresses, but humans find it more convenient to use domain names. DNS acts as a distributed database, translating domain names into IP addresses and vice versa. When a user enters a domain name in a web browser, the DNS system resolves that domain name to the corresponding IP address, allowing the client to connect to the appropriate server hosting the requested content. DNS plays a critical role in making the internet more user-friendly by enabling the use of domain names instead of numeric IP addresses for accessing resources.

# what is standalone applications?
A standalone application is a software program that operates independently on a user's device without requiring a constant connection to a network or central server. Unlike web-based or networked applications, standalone applications are self-contained and typically installed on a user's computer, mobile device, or other platforms. These applications can perform various tasks, from word processing and graphic editing to gaming and system utilities, and they run locally, relying on the device's resources rather than continuous internet connectivity. Standalone applications offer users the advantage of offline functionality and responsiveness, making them suitable for tasks that don't necessitate real-time data exchange with remote servers.

#  what is web appliocations?
Web applications, often referred to as web apps, are software programs or applications that run on web browsers. Unlike traditional desktop applications, web applications are accessed through a network, typically the internet, using a web browser as the user interface. Users can interact with web applications through a web browser on various devices, such as computers, tablets, or smartphones.

Web applications leverage a combination of web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces. The server-side of a web application often involves programming languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, or Node.js, which handle data processing, storage, and business logic.

Examples of web applications include email services like Gmail, social media platforms like Facebook, online shopping websites like Amazon, and productivity tools like Google Docs. Web applications offer the advantage of platform independence, as users can access them from different devices with a compatible web browser, without the need for installation. They have become an integral part of modern computing, providing a wide range of services and functionalities over the internet.

# Diff between Windows and Linux?
**User Interface:**
Windows and Linux differ significantly in terms of user interface. Windows typically features a graphical user interface (GUI) known for its ease of use and widespread adoption. Linux, on the other hand, provides a range of desktop environments (e.g., GNOME, KDE) and window managers, allowing users to choose the interface that suits their preferences. Linux also offers a powerful command-line interface, providing advanced users with extensive control over the system.

**Source Code and Licensing:**
One of the fundamental differences lies in the source code. Windows is a proprietary operating system developed by Microsoft, and its source code is not publicly available. In contrast, Linux is an open-source operating system, meaning its source code is accessible to the public. This openness allows users to view, modify, and distribute their versions of Linux, fostering a collaborative and transparent development environment.

**Cost:**
Windows is a commercial operating system, and users typically need to purchase a license for its usage. In contrast, Linux is free and open-source, enabling users to download, install, and use it without incurring any licensing costs. This cost difference has contributed to the widespread adoption of Linux, especially in server environments.

**File System:**
Windows primarily uses file systems such as FAT32 and NTFS, whereas Linux supports a variety of file systems, including ext4, XFS, and Btrfs. This distinction can affect compatibility between storage devices when using both operating systems on the same machine.

**Security Model:**
Linux is renowned for its robust security model. Its permission system is based on a multi-user environment, where each user has specific access rights to files and directories. Windows, historically a target for malware and viruses, has improved its security measures over the years, but Linux's security reputation is often associated with its prevalent use in server environments.

**Software Installation:**
Windows applications typically come in executable files with the extension ".exe" and are installed using installers. Linux applications are often distributed as packages, and the package manager handles installation, ensuring that dependencies are satisfied. This centralized approach simplifies software management on Linux compared to the more decentralized nature of software distribution on Windows.

**Usage and Target Audience:**
Windows is widely used in desktop environments and is a dominant player in the consumer market. It is favored for its user-friendly interface and compatibility with a vast array of software. Linux, while gaining popularity on desktops, is particularly prevalent in server environments, embedded systems, and among tech enthusiasts. It is known for its stability, performance, and customizability.

# what are kernel bootloader and shell?
**Kernel:**
The kernel is the core component of an operating system. It acts as an intermediary between the hardware and the user-level applications, managing resources such as memory, file systems, and communication between hardware devices. The kernel is responsible for essential tasks like process management, memory management, device drivers, and handling system calls. In Linux, the kernel is open-source and serves as the foundation upon which various distributions are built.

**Bootloader:**
The bootloader is a small program that resides in the computer's firmware or the Master Boot Record (MBR) of a storage device. Its primary function is to load the operating system into the computer's memory during the boot process. The bootloader initiates the boot sequence, locates the operating system's kernel, and transfers control to the kernel, allowing the operating system to start. Common bootloaders include GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader) and LILO (Linux Loader) for Linux systems, and NTLDR (New Technology Loader) and BOOTMGR for Windows systems.

**Shell:**
A shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system by entering commands. It interprets user inputs and executes commands, acting as a mediator between the user and the kernel. Shells provide features like command history, scripting capabilities, and the ability to redirect input and output. In Linux, the default shell is often Bash (Bourne Again SHell), but other shells like Zsh (Z shell) and Fish are also available. Shells can be text-based (command-line interface) or graphical (graphical user interface), providing a flexible and powerful means of controlling and managing a computer system.
